# EnhancedDiscord Theme  
A theme created for [EnhancedDiscord](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord). The goal behind it is to add some custom colors, a background and a few other improvements over the vanilla theme. If used with an up-to-date version of ED, there will be a "Theme Settings" tab to customize it. Otherwise, you can use variables (see below.)  

# How to import?  
Just download the CSS file and add it to your BDD Themes folder, Everything should work already.
